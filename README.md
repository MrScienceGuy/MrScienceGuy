- 👋 Hi, I’m @MrScienceGuy, I'm currently a lab Tech looking to branch out into another field.
- 👀 I’m interested in getting back into coding and netsec/cybersecurity while also trying to complete the Cloud Resume Challenge.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mostly just Python at this point, looking to eventually learn JS, HTML and whatever else interests me.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate with anyone willing to be patient enough to provide some guidance.
